        <h1>The Future of Web Development</h1>
        <p>The world of web development is ever-evolving, with new technologies and frameworks emerging all the time. In the future, we can expect to see advancements in areas such as progressive web apps (PWAs), serverless architectures, and AI-driven development tools.</p>
        <p>PWAs are becoming increasingly popular because they offer a native app-like experience directly in the browser. They are fast, reliable, and can work offline, making them an excellent choice for many web applications.</p>
        <p>Serverless architectures allow developers to focus on writing code without having to manage server infrastructure. This approach reduces costs and improves scalability, making it an attractive option for modern web applications.</p>
        <p>AI-driven development tools are also on the rise, helping developers automate repetitive tasks, optimize code, and improve overall productivity. As these technologies continue to evolve, the future of web development looks bright and full of exciting possibilities.</p>
