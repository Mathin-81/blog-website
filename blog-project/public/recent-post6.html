        <h1>Top 5 JavaScript Frameworks</h1>
        <p>JavaScript frameworks have revolutionized web development by providing powerful tools for building complex and interactive applications. Here are the top 5 JavaScript frameworks to consider:</p>
        <p><strong>1. React</strong>: Developed by Facebook, React is a popular framework for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture and offers excellent performance and flexibility.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Angular</strong>: Maintained by Google, Angular is a comprehensive framework for building web applications. It provides a robust set of tools for creating dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
        <p><strong>3. Vue.js</strong>: Vue.js is known for its simplicity and ease of integration. It is a progressive framework that can be adopted incrementally, making it suitable for small and large projects alike.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Svelte</strong>: Svelte is a relatively new framework that compiles components into highly efficient JavaScript at build time. This results in fast runtime performance and a smaller footprint.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Ember.js</strong>: Ember.js is designed for ambitious web applications. It follows strong conventions and provides a complete solution with a built-in router, data layer, and more.</p>
        <p>Choosing the right framework depends on your project's requirements, your familiarity with the framework, and the community support available. Each of these frameworks has its strengths, so consider your needs carefully when making a decision.</p>
